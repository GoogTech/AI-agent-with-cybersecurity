## Abstract
- Introduces a semi-autonomous penetration testing system using multiple LLM modules for strategy formulation, command generation, and result analysis.
- Experiments on Hack The Box VMs show it autonomously constructs attack strategies and reduces manual intervention.
- Highlights LLMs' limitations in reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, addressed by the proposed system.

## 1. Introduction
- Discusses LLMs' growing applications (e.g., coding, business autonomy) and their potential in cybersecurity (e.g., vulnerability detection, phishing).
- Identifies challenges in full autonomy for penetration testing due to LLMs' adaptability and knowledge gaps.
- Reviews prior LLM-based pentesting research, noting limitations in scope and environment dependency.
- Proposes a flexible, semi-autonomous system using prompt engineering (Self-Refine, ReAct) and RAG, validated on Hack The Box VMs.

## 2. Background

### 2.1. Penetration Testing
- Defines penetration testing as a manual vulnerability assessment, with recent LLM-based approaches aiming for autonomy.
- Notes limitations in existing methods, such as incomplete automation across attack phases.

### 2.2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Describes RAG as a method to enhance LLMs with external knowledge via hybrid search (keywords + vectors) and reranking.
- Enables LLMs to access up-to-date, domain-specific information for improved performance.

### 2.3. Prompt Engineering
- Explains techniques like Chain-of-Thought (step-by-step reasoning), Self-Refine (iterative refinement), and ReAct (reasoning + action).
- Enhances LLMs' reasoning for complex security tasks without additional training.

### 2.4. LLM-based Agents
- Defines LLM agents as autonomous systems for decision-making and interaction with external environments.
- Extends traditional LLMs beyond static text generation, enabling complex problem-solving.

## 3. Proposed Method

### 3.1. Overview
- Presents a system with three LLM modules: planning, execution, and summarization, integrated with RAG and tools.
- Minimizes human intervention to decision-making and monitoring, designed for Kali Linux command-line tools.

### 3.2. Planning Module
- Formulates attack strategies using a Pentesting Task Tree (PTT) based on MITRE ATT&CK.
- Uses Self-Refine and ReAct with multiple LLMs for reasoning, evaluation, and analysis to refine strategies iteratively.

### 3.3. Execution Module
- Translates strategies into executable commands, refined by multiple LLMs, with human review for safety.
- Addresses LLM hallucinations and risky operations (e.g., root privileges) requiring oversight.

### 3.4. Summarization Module
- Summarizes execution and search results, extracting critical data (e.g., credentials) without speculation.
- Improves efficiency by filtering redundant information for other modules.

### 3.5. Tools

#### 3.5.1. Information Gathering
- Combines RAG (MITRE, OWASP, Kali Linux resources in Qdrant) and web searches (NVD, GitHub) for specialized knowledge.
- Dynamically retrieves relevant data based on agent needs.

#### 3.5.2. Execution Environment
- Uses subprocess (Python) and tmux (Linux) for multi-terminal command execution in a controlled environment.

## 4. Experiment

### 4.1. Experimental Environment
- Tests conducted on Hack The Box "Board Light" VM (Easy difficulty, >4.5 user rating).
- Uses GPT-4o (planning/execution), Gemini-1.5-flash (summarization), text-embedding-3-large (embedding), and Rerank 3 (reranking).

### 4.2. Results and Discussion
- System autonomously performs pentesting, except for server exploration in password attacks.
- Planning module refines strategies (e.g., adding HTTP after SSH focus) via iterative reasoning.
- Execution module generates correct single commands but struggles with multi-step tasks (e.g., GitHub exploits), improved by dynamic searches.
- Identifies limitations in environment-specific exploration, suggesting knowledge graphs and specialized agents for future improvement.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
- Confirms the system’s ability to conduct semi-autonomous pentesting with complex reasoning and flexible knowledge retrieval.
- Notes limitations in GUI tool operation and exploratory tasks, proposing integration with systems like Anthropic’s Computer Use or OpenAI’s Operator.
- Plans to refine architecture and address identified challenges for enhanced performance.
