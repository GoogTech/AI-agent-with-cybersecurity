## Abstract
- Evaluates LLMs’ effectiveness in supporting penetration testing education using 15 tasks on Metasploitable v3 and OWASP WebGOAT.
- Compares six LLMs: GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama 3.1 405B, Mixtral 8x7B, and WhiteRabbitNeo.
- Finds GPT-4o mini most consistent, with WhiteRabbitNeo offering innovative tool suggestions, highlighting LLMs’ educational potential.

## 1. Introduction
- Discusses the growing role of AI in cybersecurity education and LLMs’ capabilities in complex tasks like coding.
- Notes the lack of prior studies on LLMs in penetration testing education, which requires diverse skills and scalability.
- Proposes an LLM-based tool for monitoring, collaboration, and feedback, addressing the research question: How well can LLMs support students in penetration testing?

## 2. Literature Review
- Reviews LLMs’ applications in cybersecurity, including CTF challenges and automated penetration testing.
- Highlights this study’s unique focus on comparing LLMs for educational purposes, assessing their suitability for training.

## 3. Methodology
- Uses a Kali Linux VM to attack Metasploitable v3 and OWASP WebGOAT VMs with 15 tasks across penetration testing stages.
- Evaluates six browser-based LLMs with prompts, scoring responses on length, relevance, usability, explanation, restrictions, variety, and creativity.
- Defines success as precise, actionable instructions validated by experts.

## 4. Results and Analysis
- GPT-4o mini and GPT-4o succeed in 13/15 tasks, WhiteRabbitNeo in 11/15, Mixtral and Llama moderately, and Gemini in 5/15 due to restrictions.
- GPT-4o mini excels in detailed explanations (ideal for education), while GPT-4o is concise (better for practical use); WhiteRabbitNeo shines in creativity.
- Gemini’s restrictions limit adaptability; bypassing them is possible but out of scope.

## 5. Conclusion
- Concludes GPT-4o mini and GPT-4o are most reliable (13/15), with WhiteRabbitNeo (11/15) enhancing creativity for education.
- Suggests combining GPT-4o mini with WhiteRabbitNeo; notes limitations in model diversity, task variety, and single-response evaluation.
- Plans future research on complex tasks, student cohorts, prompt variations, and multiple responses for robustness.
