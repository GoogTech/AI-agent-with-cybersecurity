- Proposes two new **CTF-based benchmarks** using PicoCTF and OverTheWire, with 200 challenges.
- Conducts experiments on parameters like creativity (temperature, top-p) and token utilization, with **GPT-4o** performing best.
- Discusses safety, predictability, and the need for robust safeguards.
- Makes HackSynth and benchmarks publicly available for research.

## 1. Introduction
- Highlights the growing complexity of cyber threats and the limitations of manual penetration testing.
- Discusses existing automation tools (e.g., Nessus, Snyk, OpenVAS) and their lack of adaptability.
- Notes advancements in LLMs and their potential in cybersecurity, referencing initiatives like DARPA’s AIxCC.
- Reviews prior LLM-based tools (e.g., PentestGPT, HackingBuddyGPT) and their limitations in autonomy.
- Identifies gaps in understanding LLM-based agents' mechanisms, decision-making, and risks.

## 2. Background

### 2.1. Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges
- Describes CTF challenges as educational tools covering domains like web exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, binary exploitation, and general skills.
- Lists prominent platforms (e.g., HackTheBox, TryHackMe) and competitions (e.g., DEF CON CTF).

### 2.2. Heuristic CTF Solvers
- Discusses traditional heuristic tools (e.g., Katana, Remenissions) that automate specific tasks but lack adaptability and creativity.

### 2.3. LLMs in Cybersecurity
- Outlines LLM applications in defensive (e.g., secure coding, vulnerability detection) and offensive (e.g., malware generation, phishing) cybersecurity tasks.
- Notes LLMs' limitations, such as not fully replacing human expertise in malware detection.

### 2.4. LLM Agents
- Defines LLM agents as autonomous systems for decision-making and action execution.
- Mentions examples in software engineering (e.g., OpenHands, Devika) and multi-agent frameworks (e.g., MetaGPT, CrewAI).
- Highlights potential in cybersecurity for tasks like penetration testing.

### 2.5. LLM Agents for CTF Challenges
- Reviews existing LLM-based agents (e.g., HackingBuddyGPT, AutoAttacker, PentestGPT, Enigma) and their capabilities/limitations, such as reliance on specific tools or human intervention.

### 2.6. Datasets for Pentesting Agents
- Describes existing datasets (e.g., NYU CTF, Intercode CTF, Cybench) and their limitations, such as static flags or lack of hints/difficulty ratings.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1. HackSynth
- Presents HackSynth’s architecture with two LLM-based modules: **Planner** (command generation) and **Summarizer** (history tracking).
- Operates in a containerized Kali Linux environment with firewall security.

#### 3.1.1. Planner Module
- Generates single, executable commands using prompts that emphasize CTF context, avoiding repetition, and prioritizing efficiency.

#### 3.1.2. Summarizer Module
- Maintains a detailed history of actions and outputs, filtering irrelevant data using a **new observation window size** parameter to manage output length.

#### 3.1.3. Operational Workflow
- Describes a cyclical process: command generation, execution, output summarization, and iteration until flag capture or iteration limit.

#### 3.1.4. Securing HackSynth
- Addresses risks like unauthorized interactions or local system damage, mitigated by containerization and firewall restrictions.
- Notes challenges in firewall rule enforcement and potential bypass methods, calling for future research on safety measures.

### 3.2. Benchmarks
- Proposes two benchmarks (PicoCTF, OverTheWire) with 200 challenges across six categories and three difficulty levels.
- Includes challenge descriptions, hints, files, categories, difficulties, and dynamic solver scripts.

#### 3.2.1. PicoCTF
- Selects 120 challenges from over 300, improving on Intercode by adding difficulty, hints, and solver functions for dynamic flag handling.
- Excludes challenges requiring personalized instances due to ethical/resource constraints.

#### 3.2.2. OverTheWire
- Includes four wargames (Bandit, Natas, Leviathan, Krypton) covering Linux commands, web security, binary exploitation, and cryptography.

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1. Parameter Optimization
- Tests **new observation window size**, finding optimal values of 250 (PicoCTF) and 500 (OverTheWire) for balancing information retention and relevance.
- Analyzes **temperature**, recommending values ≤1 for reliability, as higher values increase errors and system instability.
- Examines **top-p**, noting modest performance gains with higher values but increased use of rare commands.
- Tests additional parameters, finding sampling beneficial but prompt-chaining detrimental.

### 4.2. Benchmark Runs
- Evaluates eight LLMs, with **GPT-4o** solving the most challenges (41/120 PicoCTF, 32/80 OverTheWire).
- Notes **Llama-3.1-70B** as the best local model, outperforming **GPT-4o-mini** in some cases.
- Discusses speed, cost, and category-specific performance, with minimal variation across categories.
- Analyzes iterative performance, token usage, and model-specific command tendencies (e.g., **Qwen2-72B**’s frequent use of sudo).

## 5. Behavioral Analysis of HackSynth

### 5.1. Insight on the Solving Process
- Compares HackSynth’s strategies to human approaches, highlighting creative adaptations due to non-interactive constraints (e.g., using autoppep8 instead of editors).
- Notes tendencies to repeat ineffective commands, mitigated by summarizer history.

### 5.2. Human Evaluation
- Conducts human evaluation of HackSynth’s outputs, finding commands generally sensible but sometimes overly complex or risky (e.g., using sudo unnecessarily).
- Suggests improvements in filtering ineffective commands and enhancing safety.

## 6. Discussion
- Emphasizes HackSynth’s potential in autonomous cybersecurity and the need for standardized benchmarks.
- Suggests future enhancements, such as specialized modules, fine-tuning, and networked environment testing.
- Proposes evaluating HackSynth in live CTF events and addressing ethical/security risks.

## 7. Conclusion
- Summarizes HackSynth as an effective autonomous agent, validated by new benchmarks.
- Stresses the importance of parameter tuning, safety measures, and public availability for research.
- Calls for future work on architecture, fine-tuning, and realistic scenarios.
